At Aqua Echange, we purify our water using UV technology and sterilize our bottles using Gamma Rays

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a disinfection method that uses short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-C) light to kill or inactivate microorganisms by destroying nucleic acids and disrupting their DNA, leaving them unable to perform vital cellular functions

Gamma rays (also called gamma radiation), are penetrating electromagnetic radiation of a kind arising from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei.
